# Beef-Bacteria-Research

## Overview
### Help Rosa a biological researcher discover and document bacteria that have an ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She wants our help to create an engaging and dynamic chart to share her findings. To do so we will perform the following steps:

1. Master the basics of Plotly.
2. Identify the types of charts she can create with Plotly.
3. Retrieve the belly button data by using D3.js library to read external JSON files, as well as place calls to external web APIs for data.
4. Create visuals to help her volunteers identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
